version 0.003; 2010-10-24

  * bugfix: for Perls that use the ghost context frame but don't put
    cxinc() in the API (mainly 5.8.9 and 5.10), provide a reserve
    definition of cxinc()

  * bugfix: for Perl 5.13.1+, don't assert anything about the ghost
    context frame that was significant on earlier Perl versions

  * in XS, use gv_stashpvs() wherever appropriate

  * in XS, use PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT for efficiency

  * in XS, declare "PROTOTYPES: DISABLE" to prevent automatic generation
    of unintended prototypes

  * in documentation, mention Scope::Escape::Sugar in the first paragraph
    of the description

  * jump through hoops to avoid compiler warnings

  * use full stricture in test suite

  * in Build.PL, complete declaration of configure-time requirements

  * remove commented-out debugging code

version 0.002; 2010-05-23

  * update for new PL_restartjmpenv unwinding mechanism in perl 5.13.1
    and above

  * remove from documentation most of the discussion about stack
    unwinding, which has moved to the documentation of Scope::Cleanup

  * in documentation, add Scope::Cleanup and Scope::Escape::Sugar to
    "see also" list

  * in t/die.t and t/multi.t, require Scope::Upper version 0.08 or later
    if Scope::Upper is to be used, due to earlier versions corrupting
    the stack when reap() is used and thus causing false test failures

version 0.001; 2010-03-30

  * make current_escape_{function,continuation} operators compile
    correctly when imported lexically via Lexical::Import

  * new S::E::Continuation methods as_{function,continuation} to
    provide access to a continuation in both unblessed and blessed forms
    regardless of the form in which it was created

  * include parent in dependency list

  * initial released version
