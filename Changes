version 0.002; 2010-05-23

  * update for new PL_restartjmpenv unwinding mechanism in perl 5.13.1
    and above

  * remove from documentation most of the discussion about stack
    unwinding, which has moved to the documentation of Scope::Cleanup

  * in documentation, add Scope::Cleanup and Scope::Escape::Sugar to
    "see also" list

  * in t/die.t and t/multi.t, require Scope::Upper version 0.08 or later
    if Scope::Upper is to be used, due to earlier versions corrupting
    the stack when reap() is used and thus causing false test failures

version 0.001; 2010-03-30

  * make current_escape_{function,continuation} operators compile
    correctly when imported lexically via Lexical::Import

  * new S::E::Continuation methods as_{function,continuation} to
    provide access to a continuation in both unblessed and blessed forms
    regardless of the form in which it was created

  * include parent in dependency list

version 0.000; 2010-03-23

  * initial released version
